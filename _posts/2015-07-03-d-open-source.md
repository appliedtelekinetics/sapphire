Sapphire is great because it's built on top of great things. The software and electronics are based on Arduino&trade; and other open-source hardware designs. Future beta designs will aim for complete Arduino compatibility so Sapphire can be used as a mobile development platform.

The source code used in Sapphire is <a class="ul" href="https://github.com/appliedtelekinetics/sapphire-software" target="_blank">available on Github</a>. Electronic schematics are not yet published but will be made available with the next beta designs are finalized.

Design files for the 3D Printed parts are also <a class="ul" href="https://github.com/appliedtelekinetics/sapphire-hardware" target="_blank">available on Github</a> under a non-commercial license.
