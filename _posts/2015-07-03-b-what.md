### _Sapphire_ start with a problem.

If you use crutches to get around and you listen to music while you're at it, how do you do something simple like turning up the volume? Most people think it's no big deal, but someone who uses crutches every day knows how stuff that sounds easy can get complicated really fast.

You could stop, sit down (if you can even find a place to sit!), pull out your phone, change the volume and get up again.

You could balance with one crutch, let go of the other and hope it doesn't fall while you're fishing around in your bag for your phone.

Even headphones with a built-in remote won't save because you still have to let go of the crutch handle to push the buttons.

And finally, after all that, you have to hope you're not going to need to do it all over again for the next song.

### There should be a better way, so we made one.

<div class="fluid-container">
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-1 col-sm-1 col-xs-0"></div>
    <div class="col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-3 col-xs-12">
      <img class="img-rounded img-responsive center-block"  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/close_angle_with_hand.jpg" alt="close up of Sapphire installed in crutch handle">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
      <p>The idea is <em>simple</em>, put a <strong>Bluetooth remote control</strong> in a <strong>crutch handle</strong> so you can <strong>control your music without having to let go</strong>.</p>
      <p>The result is <em>pure awesome</em>. <img class="emoji img-rounded" src="{{ sitebase.url }}/img/laughing-face.png" alt="Smiling Emoji making heavy-metal music gesture" title="Rock out."></p>

### See how it works.

Here are some videos that show you how Sapphire works and how to install it. Remember that model shown is a prototype and the design and features may change.

INSTALLATION AND PAIRING VIDEO

Highlights:

* Uses Bluetooth, an open standard.
* Does **not** require a app to be installed on your phone.
* Charges using a Micro-USB, the same connector used by many mobile phones.
* The electronics and the software are open-source.

Important notes regarding our current prototypes:

* At the moment they only work with Walk Easy&trade; brand forearm crutches. We hope to support other brands and styles in the future.
* They have been tested with iOS and Android only. We plan to support more operating systems in the future.
