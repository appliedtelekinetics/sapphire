### _Sapphire_ start with a problem.

If you use crutches to get around and you listen to music while you're at it, how do you do something simple like turning up the volume? Most people think it's no big deal, but someone who uses crutches every day knows how stuff that sounds easy can get complicated really fast.

You could stop, sit down (if you can even find a place to sit!), pull out your phone, change the volume and get up again.

You could balance with one crutch, let go of the other and hope it doesn't fall while you're fishing around in your bag for your phone.

Even headphones with a built-in remote won't save because you still have to let go of the crutch handle to push the buttons.

And finally, after all that, you have to hope you're not going to need to do it all over again for the next song.

What. A. Pain. <img class="emoji img-rounded" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/grimacing-face.png" alt="Grimacing face emoji" title="Grr.">

### There should be a better way, so we made one.

      <p>The idea is <em>simple</em>, put a <strong>Bluetooth remote control</strong> in a <strong>crutch handle</strong> so you can <strong>control your music without having to let go</strong>.</p>
      <p>The result is <em>pure awesome</em>. <img class="emoji img-rounded" src="{{ sitebase.url }}/img/laughing-face.png" alt="Smiling Emoji making heavy-metal music gesture" title="Rock out."></p>

With Sapphire, you can control the music on your Bluetooth-enabled smartphone with just one finger. No sitting, no fumbling, you don't even have to stop walking. You can even use it to turn in Siri&trade; or Google Now&trade;.

It's compatible with iOS and Android. It uses Bluetooth, an open standard, and doesn't require a special app. It charges using a Micro-USB, the same connector used by most many modern smartphones. The electronics and the software are open-source.
