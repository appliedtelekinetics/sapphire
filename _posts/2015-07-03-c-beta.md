It's time we learn how Sapphire works in the real world. **That's where you come in**. We're looking people to test designs, give us feedback and tell us what works and what doesn't.

**Everyone** is invited to be part of our feedback group. That's where we'll show you what we're working on and get your input about it. To sign up, please click here join our feedback mailing list.

**Beta Testers** are the people we send Sapphire test units to so we can see how they work when real people use them.

The beta-tester program is free, we'll even cover the cost to ship your beta unit to you and back to us when the test is over. Yeah, you'll have to send it back to us at the end. We know that sucks, but that's the rule.

Not everyone will be able to be a beta-tester. We need people with special qualifications so we can learn what is good about our product and what isn't so good. A good beta-tester will:
